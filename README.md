# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
* npm i -- you know what it does!
* npm start -- runs app in dev mode on http://localhost:3000
* npm test -- runs test runners. currently not applicable.
* npm run build -- makes a build of the app for deployment
* npm run eject -- does anyone use this? please dont
* firebase deploy -- deploys the latest build

But I'm using Bit now!
* bit init -- makes workspace.json, .bitmap, hidden bit files
* bit start -- starts local dev server; see everything is rendered in isolation
* bit install -- installs dependencies
* bit compile -- ensure compilation is successful
* bit test -- runs tests in isolation
* bit check-types -- validate type script types
